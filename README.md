# Roblox Lua Learning Archive

This repository contains my structured learning notes and scripts
while studying Roblox Lua, GUIs, and input systems.

Each file focuses on a single concept for clarity and reference.
This repo is for learning and experimentation, not production use.

# Notes

Basics Contains my Knowledge of Simple Stuff

GUI Just has basic GUI scripts

Advanced Scripts has my basic stuff.

Systems is just me working on System Programs.

Once I master scripting none of my newer scripts will be for public use, Unless I contribute to OpenSource Projects.
