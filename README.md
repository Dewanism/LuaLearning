#Roblox Lua Learning Archive

This repository contains my structured learning notes and practice scripts while studying:

Roblox Lua

GUI systems

Text formatting

Player input mechanics

Each folder and file focuses on a single concept for clarity, reference, and long-term reuse.
This repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and skill development, not production use.

#Notes

This repository reflects my learning progression, not polished implementations

Scripts may be incomplete, experimental, or intentionally simplified

Once I fully master scripting, future projects will not be public unless I contribute to open-source projects
